This project addresses some pathologies that were asked of
a college professor, he had requested a website with information on these pathologies that 
are the most affecting the population and integrate the site into a BOT that would 
make a kind of pre-consultation and give a diagnosis of which pathology the patient
is being affected by, the diagnosis is NOT RIGHT AND HAD NO MEDICAL HELP TO GIVE 
THE DIAGNOSIS then the BOT created by Microsoft's LOUIS platform was created on the 
basis of what we know when someone says that they are in pain.
