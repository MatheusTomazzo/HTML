WebSite Project Anhanguera with Bootstrap Modals.

This is a college project, made in html, css and bootstrap, mods were made in bootstrap and the images contain the area map feature that triggers the modal trigger, it's simple but it took a while to be done, in the future we want to put a BOT for care and to make a pre-consultation of pathologies, the pathologies registered will be those that the site is only citing.
I hope to help with something with these codes.
thank you!!

if you can help me to complement something in this code let me know by this email matomazzo@hotmail.com
